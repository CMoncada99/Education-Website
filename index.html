<div><center> <b> Clicking on the this picture will take you to the SQL Project. </b> </center> </div>
<div>
<p> The aforementioned project was successfully completed during the Fall 2021 semester. The project involved a comprehensive analysis of multiple Spotify data sets, leveraging data integration techniques to identify similarities and differences among them. The schema provided a visual representation of the table connections, while the data dictionary offered a detailed description of the values within each table. Additionally, the project encompassed the development of both simple and complex queries to facilitate diverse data analysis tasks.

A particular aspect of the project delved into an experimental topic that I personally found intriguing, providing in-depth insights. Furthermore, the concluding section of the project showcased the application of data visualization techniques to perform detailed analysis and gain valuable insights from the database. This demonstrated my ability to analyze databases and present information in a user-friendly manner.

In the context of making informed business decisions, it is imperative to present data in a manner that is easily comprehensible to stakeholders who may not possess an extensive understanding of the underlying data. Thus, the project emphasized the significance of creating clear and intelligible visualizations, ensuring that decision-makers can utilize the visualized data to make informed choices.

<div><center> <b> Clicking on the this picture will take you to my Tableau Project. </b> </center> </div>
<p> This project represents a significant accomplishment in the Data Visualization course, completed during the Spring 2022 semester. The objective of the project was to analyze multiple Spotify datasets, focusing on various factors such as popularity, danceability, beats per minute, and loudness, among others.

The first visualization presented the top songs within the dataset, considering their danceability and energy levels. The second visualization depicted the evolution of music loudness over the years, illustrating a noticeable increase throughout the time period. Additionally, the third visualization showcased the changing trends in energy and danceability over the years, highlighting their overlapping patterns.

Furthermore, the project included a series of rankings and provided a comprehensive analysis at the conclusion. This aspect of the project was particularly valuable in the context of business, as it enabled the examination and prediction of trends. By observing the changes in data over time, such as the popularity of a product or service, valuable insights could be gained to inform the implementation of novel offerings in the market. </p>

<div><center> <b> Clicking on the this picture will take you to the Project Management assignment. </b> </center> </div>
<p> This project represents a significant achievement in the Project Management course, undertaken during the Spring 2022 semester. The project focuses on a comprehensive analysis of outsourcing within the information technology industry. It delves into the historical context of outsourcing, explores its benefits, examines its drawbacks, and provides guidance on when and why a company should consider utilizing outsourcing or refrain from doing so.

To enrich the analysis, the project incorporates insights from both current and former employees of outsourcing companies, capturing their firsthand experiences, including both positive and negative aspects. These insights contribute to a well-rounded understanding of the outsourcing landscape and its impact on business operations.

The findings of this project hold relevance beyond the specific context of the information technology industry. The tools and methods employed in outsourcing have become widely adopted in various business sectors, particularly in the information technology field. Therefore, understanding the dynamics and considerations surrounding outsourcing is valuable knowledge for professionals operating within the broader business environment. </p>

      <h3>ZOOM: CULTIVATING HUMAN CONNECTION
IN A DIGITAL WORLD</h3>
<a href="file:///C:/Users/crmb1/Downloads/Article%202_%20Zoom%20Cultivating%20Human%20Connection%20in%20a%20Digital%20World.pdf">Link to the article</a>
     <p> The surge in remote collaboration facilitated by platforms like Zoom during the global pandemic marked a significant paradigm shift in our perception of technology as a tool. COVID-19 fundamentally transformed our daily operations, with profound implications for the information technology landscape. Video conferencing tools such as Zoom enabled employees to seamlessly transition to remote work, leading to notable improvements in productivity and overall job satisfaction.

This transition to remote work has brought forth numerous benefits. Employers are no longer burdened with the need to rent office spaces, while employees are no longer constrained by the necessity of being physically present on-site to perform their duties. Moreover, the geographical constraints on talent acquisition have been significantly relaxed, as organizations can now recruit professionals from across the country or even across the globe without requiring them to relocate.

The digital transformation experienced worldwide during the pandemic extended far beyond remote work, impacting various aspects of daily operations. Processes that were once predominantly conducted in person, such as documentation, interviews, and even educational classes, successfully migrated to the digital realm. This shift not only proved the viability of a digital-only world but also demonstrated the remarkable efficiency and ease of digital operations.

The tools that emerged in response to the COVID-19 crisis continue to be widely employed in day-to-day operations, as they have become integral to modern workflows. Recognizing their increased importance, ongoing improvements are being made to further optimize these tools, ensuring they remain reliable and efficient for their expanded usage in various professional settings. </p>
